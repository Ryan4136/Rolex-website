                        <h3>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date 1500</h3>
                        <p>Introduced in the early 1960s and known as the slightly smaller brother to the iconic Datejust, the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date ref. 1500 is the perfect vintage Rolex watch for daily wear and use. Robust enough to stand the rigors of everyday life but classic enough to be worn with a suit and tie, the Rolex Date reference shares the same in-house, chronometer-certified Perpetual movement as its larger Datejust sibling, granting it identical performance despite its smaller case diameter and lower price point.</p>

                        <h3>The First Factory</h3>
                        <p>Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded Wilsdorf and Davis, the company that would eventually become Rolex SA, in London in 1905. Wilsdorf and Davis's main commercial activity at the time involved importing Hermann Aegler's Swiss movements to England and placing them in watch cases made by Dennison and others. These early wristwatches were sold to many jewellers, who then put their own names on the dial. The earliest watches from Wilsdorf and Davis were usually hallmarked "W&D" inside the caseback.</p>

                        <h3>Production</h3>
                        <p>Each Rolex comes with a unique serial number, which can help indicate its approximate production period. Serial numbers were first introduced in 1926 and were issued sequentially, until 1954, when Rolex restarted from #999,999 to #0. In 1987, there was an addition of one letter to a 6-digit serial number and in 2010, to the present date Rolex introduced random serial numbers.</p>
