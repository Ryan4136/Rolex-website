            <h3>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date 1500</h3>
            <p>The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date 1500 is a highly regarded vintage model produced during the 1960s and 1970s, known for its timeless design and robust construction. It features a 34mm stainless steel Oyster case with a screw-down crown, offering water resistance of up to 100 meters, and houses the reliable automatic caliber 1570 movement, which is COSC-certified for its precision. The dial, available in classic colors like silver, black, and champagne, includes a date window at 3 o’clock with the signature Cyclops lens for magnification. The watch typically comes with either an Oyster or Jubilee stainless steel bracelet, and its acrylic crystal, while prone to scratches, can easily be polished. The self-winding mechanism, characteristic of Rolex's Perpetual series, ensures the watch winds automatically with wrist movement. Its vintage appeal, reliable performance, and more affordable pricing in the pre-owned market make the Rolex 1500 a sought-after piece for collectors, with many appreciating its understated elegance and versatility for both casual and formal wear.</p>
